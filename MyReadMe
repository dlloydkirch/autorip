I forked the Repo from https://github.com/ejb1123/autorip so I could play with the settings. 

I was also having an issue where it was not saving to the directory I wanted, so I will work on that. 

I will also add some comments to help show what I was doing, inside the code.

I take no claim to ownership or creation of this program, it is an open source project and the license
should be included.  See the ReadMe for more information.
